Ecoleta is a marketplace to collect specific waste.

Project developed on Next Level Week 01 event by [RocketSeat](https://github.com/Rocketseat).ðŸš€.

The original project was to build a web application for registering recyclable garbage collection points and a mobile application in react native to list the registered points.
I decided to create just one web application containing everything.
